# spicy_stun (WIP)
STUN parser for Zeek written with [Zeeks](https://github.com/zeek/zeek) [Spicy](https://github.com/zeek/spicy).

After my initial work the code has been [expanded and improved by @keithjjones](https://github.com/keithjjones/spicy-analyzers/tree/fix_stun/analyzer/protocol/stun) and [merged into Zeek master](https://github.com/zeek/spicy-analyzers/pull/67).

This repo is now archived.
